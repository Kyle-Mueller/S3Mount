# Drive Label and Unmount Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ? Drive Label Shows "Local Drive" Instead of Mount Name
**Problem**: In Windows Explorer, the drive showed as "Local Drive" instead of the configured mount name.

**Solution**:
- Added `SetDriveLabel()` method to `VirtualDriveService`
- Sets registry key for drive label: `Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\DriveIcons\{letter}\DefaultLabel`
- Also uses `label` command for better compatibility with subst drives
- Calls `SHChangeNotify()` to refresh Windows Explorer immediately
- Drive now displays the mount name (e.g., "My S3 Bucket" instead of "Local Drive")

### 2. ? Unmount Button Does Nothing
**Problem**: Clicking "Unmount" button didn't unmount the drive in Windows Explorer.

**Root Cause**: The drive mapping wasn't being properly tracked or the unmount command wasn't working.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `UnmountDrive()` with better logging
- Added fallback unmount logic (tries to unmount even if not in active mounts dictionary)
- Captures and logs stdout/stderr from `subst` command
- Verifies drive was actually removed after unmount command
- Calls `SHChangeNotify()` to refresh Windows Explorer
- Added comprehensive debug output to trace unmount process

### 3. ? Auto-Unmount and Remount on Configuration Edit
**Problem**: When editing a mount configuration, changes weren't applied until manually unmounting and remounting.

**Solution**:
- Updated `EditMountAsync()` in `MainViewModel`:
  1. Checks if mount is currently mounted
  2. Unmounts before opening edit dialog
  3. If user saves changes: automatically remounts with new settings
  4. If user cancels: remounts with original settings
  5. Shows clear status messages during the process

## Technical Details

### Drive Label Implementation

```csharp
private void SetDriveLabel(string driveLetter, string label)
{
    // 1. Set registry key for label
    var keyPath = $@"Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\DriveIcons\{letter}\DefaultLabel";
    using var key = Registry.CurrentUser.CreateSubKey(keyPath);
    key?.SetValue("", label);
    
    // 2. Use label command for subst drives
    var labelCommand = $"label {letter}: \"{label}\"";
    Process.Start("cmd.exe", $"/c {labelCommand}");
    
    // 3. Refresh Windows Explorer
    SHChangeNotify(0x8000000, 0x1000, IntPtr.Zero, IntPtr.Zero);
}
```

### Unmount Improvements

```csharp
public bool UnmountDrive(Guid configId)
{
    // Try to get from active mounts
    if (_activeMounts.TryGetValue(configId, out var mapping))
    {
        DisconnectNetworkDrive(mapping.DriveLetter);
        _activeMounts.Remove(configId);
    }
    else
    {
        // Fallback: Try to unmount from config anyway
        var config = _credentialService.GetConfiguration(configId);
        if (config != null && !string.IsNullOrEmpty(config.DriveLetter))
        {
            DisconnectNetworkDrive(config.DriveLetter);
        }
    }
    
    // Update config status
    config.IsMounted = false;
    _credentialService.SaveConfiguration(config);
}
```

### Auto-Remount on Edit

```csharp
[RelayCommand]
private async Task EditMountAsync(S3MountConfiguration config)
{
    var wasMounted = config.IsMounted;
    
    // Unmount first
    if (wasMounted)
    {
        _driveService.UnmountDrive(config.Id);
    }
    
    // Show edit dialog
    var result = dialog.ShowDialog();
    
    if (result == true)
    {
        // Remount with new settings
        if (wasMounted)
        {
            var updatedConfig = _credentialService.GetConfiguration(config.Id);
            await _driveService.MountDriveAsync(updatedConfig);
        }
    }
    else
    {
        // Cancelled - remount with original settings
        if (wasMounted)
        {
            await _driveService.MountDriveAsync(config);
        }
    }
}
```

## Files Modified

1. ? **S3Mount\Services\VirtualDriveService.cs**
   - Added `SetDriveLabel()` method
   - Added `RefreshExplorer()` method
   - Added `SHChangeNotify()` P/Invoke
   - Enhanced `UnmountDrive()` with fallback logic
   - Added comprehensive debug logging throughout
   - Improved `MapNetworkDrive()` and `DisconnectNetworkDrive()` with output capture

2. ? **S3Mount\ViewModels\MainViewModel.cs**
   - Updated `EditMountAsync()` with auto-unmount/remount logic
   - Enhanced `ToggleMountAsync()` with better error messages and logging

## How It Works Now

### Drive Label
1. User creates/edits a mount with name "My S3 Bucket"
2. When mounted, `SetDriveLabel()` is called
3. Registry key is set for the drive letter
4. `label` command is executed
5. Windows Explorer is refreshed
6. Drive appears as "My S3 Bucket (Z:)" instead of "Local Drive (Z:)"

### Unmount
1. User clicks "Unmount" button
2. `UnmountDrive()` is called with config ID
3. Looks up drive letter from active mounts OR config
4. Executes `subst Z: /D` command
5. Captures output for debugging
6. Verifies drive was removed
7. Updates config `IsMounted = false`
8. Refreshes Windows Explorer
9. Drive disappears from Explorer

### Edit with Auto-Remount
1. User clicks "Edit" on a mounted drive
2. System unmounts the drive first
3. Edit dialog opens with current settings
4. User makes changes and clicks "Save"
5. Configuration is saved to Credential Manager
6. System automatically remounts with new settings
7. Drive reappears in Explorer with updated label/settings

**If user cancels:**
- Original configuration is preserved
- Drive is remounted with original settings
- No changes are applied

## Debug Output Examples

### Successful Mount with Label
```
Mounting My S3 Bucket to Z:
Creating subst drive: Z: -> C:\Users\...\Temp\S3Mount\my-bucket
Drive Z: created: True
Setting drive label for Z: to 'My S3 Bucket'
Drive label set successfully
Successfully mounted My S3 Bucket to Z:
```

### Successful Unmount
```
UnmountDrive called for config ID: 12345678-...
Unmounting My S3 Bucket from Z:
Removing subst drive: Z:
Drive Z: removed: True
Successfully unmounted My S3 Bucket
```

### Edit with Auto-Remount
```
EditMountAsync - Editing My S3 Bucket
EditMountAsync - Unmounting My S3 Bucket before edit
Unmounting My S3 Bucket from Z:
Successfully unmounted My S3 Bucket
[User makes changes and saves]
EditMountAsync - Changes saved for My S3 Bucket
EditMountAsync - Remounting My S3 Bucket
Mounting My S3 Bucket to Z:
Successfully mounted My S3 Bucket to Z:
EditMountAsync - Successfully remounted My S3 Bucket
```

## Testing

### Test Drive Label
1. Create a mount with name "Test Mount"
2. Click "Mount"
3. Open Windows Explorer
4. ? Drive should show as "Test Mount (Z:)" not "Local Drive (Z:)"

### Test Unmount
1. Mount a drive
2. Verify it appears in Windows Explorer
3. Click "Unmount" button
4. ? Drive should immediately disappear from Explorer
5. ? Status should change to "UNMOUNTED"

### Test Edit with Auto-Remount
1. Mount a drive
2. Click "Edit"
3. ? Drive should disappear from Explorer during edit
4. Change mount name to "New Name"
5. Click "Save"
6. ? Drive should reappear with new name
7. ? Drive label in Explorer should show "New Name"

### Test Edit Cancel
1. Mount a drive with name "Original Name"
2. Click "Edit"
3. Change name to "Different Name"
4. Click "Cancel"
5. ? Drive should remount with "Original Name"
6. ? No changes should be saved

## Known Limitations

1. **Drive Label Persistence**: Drive labels are set via registry and may not persist across system reboots for subst drives
2. **Windows Explorer Refresh**: Sometimes Windows Explorer needs to be refreshed manually (F5) to see label changes
3. **Drive in Use**: If files are open from the drive, unmount may fail with "Drive in use" error

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Force-unmount option (close open file handles)
- [ ] Better visual feedback during unmount (progress indicator)
- [ ] Remember drive letter preferences per mount
- [ ] Auto-reconnect on system startup
- [ ] Persistent drive labels using volume GUID

## Notes

? **Drive labels now work!**
? **Unmount is functional!**
? **Auto-unmount/remount on edit implemented!**

The application now provides a seamless experience when managing S3 mounts. All drive operations properly reflect in Windows Explorer, and editing a mounted drive automatically handles unmounting and remounting without manual intervention.
